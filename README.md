## ‚ú® Project Overview

**Stack Overflow Bank** is a comprehensive web application that simulates a real-world banking environment. Built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), it provides a robust platform for customers, employees, and administrators. The application features role-based access control, secure authentication with OTP verification, and a clean, intuitive user interface powered by Ant Design. From dynamic dashboards with data visualizations to core banking functionalities like account creation and fund transfers, this project showcases a complete end-to-end development cycle, from local setup to cloud deployment on platforms like Render and Netlify.

## üîë Key Features

The application is segregated into three distinct user panels, each with tailored functionalities and security measures.

### **üîê Security & Authentication**
- **Role-Based Access Control:** A custom `Guard` component protects frontend routes, verifying the user's role (`admin`, `employee`, `customer`) against their JWT token before granting access.
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure, stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens. Passwords are never stored in plaintext; they are hashed using `bcrypt`.
- **Session Persistence:** User session information is stored in **`localStorage`**, allowing users to stay logged in across browser sessions. The `Guard` component ensures this data is validated on every protected route visit.
- **Email OTP Verification:** **`Nodemailer`** is integrated into the backend to send One-Time Passwords (OTPs) for critical actions like user registration or password recovery, adding an extra layer of security.

### **üë®‚Äçüíº Admin Panel**
The Admin has the highest level of authority and oversees the entire banking operation.
- **Analytical Dashboard:** An interactive dashboard featuring `Chart.js` visualizations of key metrics like total transactions, user growth, and branch performance.
- **Employee Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing bank employees.
- **Branch Management:** Ability to add new bank branches to the system.

### **üßë‚Äçüíª Employee Panel**
Employees are responsible for customer-facing operations and day-to-day banking tasks.
- **Customer Account Creation:** Employees can onboard new customers by creating new bank accounts.
- **Transaction Management:** Facilitate deposits and withdrawals for customers, ensuring accurate record-keeping.

### **üë§ Customer Panel**
The customer panel provides a seamless and secure digital banking experience.
- **Visual Dashboard:** A personalized dashboard that presents financial summaries through interactive charts (Bar and Doughnut) powered by `Chart.js` and `react-chartjs-2`.
- **Transaction History:** A detailed, paginated, and searchable table of all past transactions.
- **Profile Management:** Customers can view and update their personal information. Profile images are uploaded and served via **ImageKit.io** for fast delivery.
- **Payee Management:** A crucial feature allowing customers to add, view, and delete payees (beneficiaries) for quick and easy fund transfers.
- **Fund Transfers:** A secure form to transfer funds to saved payees.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started (Local Setup)

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps.

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm & Git
- A MongoDB Atlas account
- An ImageKit.io account
- A Gmail account (or other email service) for Nodemailer, with an "App Password" generated.

### **Installation & Setup**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/roshansaini18/S.O-Bank.git](https://github.com/roshansaini18/S.O-Bank.git)
    cd S.O-Bank
    ```

2.  **Setup Backend (`server` directory):**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following variables:
    ```env
    MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string"
    JWT_SECRET="your_strong_jwt_secret_key"
    
    # ImageKit Credentials
    IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY="your_imagekit_public_key"
    IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY="your_imagekit_private_key"
    IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT="your_imagekit_url_endpoint"

    # Nodemailer Credentials
    EMAIL_USER="your_email@gmail.com"
    EMAIL_PASS="your_gmail_app_password"
    ```

3.  **Setup Frontend (`client` directory):**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and add the following variable:
    ```env
    REACT_APP_API_URL="http://localhost:5000" # Or your backend server port
    ```

4.  **Run the Application:**
    - **Run the backend server:** From the `server` directory, run:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```
    - **Run the frontend application:** From the `client` directory, run:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
