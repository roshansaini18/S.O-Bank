## ‚ú® Project Overview

**Stack Overflow Bank** is a comprehensive web application that simulates a real-world banking environment. Built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), it provides a robust platform for customers, employees, and administrators. The application features role-based access control, secure authentication, and a clean, intuitive user interface powered by Ant Design. From dynamic dashboards with data visualizations to core banking functionalities like account creation and fund transfers, this project showcases a complete end-to-end development cycle, from local setup to cloud deployment.

---

## üîë Key Features

The application is segregated into three distinct user panels, each with tailored functionalities.

### **üë®‚Äçüíº Admin Panel**

The Admin has the highest level of authority and oversees the entire banking operation.
- **Secure Login:** Dedicated login portal for administrators.
- **Analytical Dashboard:** An interactive dashboard featuring charts and key metrics, such as total transactions, user growth, and branch performance, visualized using `Chart.js`.
- **Employee Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing bank employees.
- **Branch Management:** Ability to add new bank branches to the system, expanding the bank's network.
- **System Configuration:** Manage core application settings like branding and accepted currencies.

### **üßë‚Äçüíª Employee Panel**

Employees are responsible for customer-facing operations and day-to-day banking tasks.
- **Secure Login:** Dedicated login portal for employees.
- **Operational Dashboard:** A dashboard summarizing daily tasks and key customer metrics.
- **Customer Account Creation:** Employees can onboard new customers by creating new bank accounts.
- **Transaction Management:** Facilitate deposits and withdrawals on behalf of customers, ensuring accurate record-keeping.

### **üë§ Customer Panel**

The customer panel provides a seamless and secure digital banking experience.
- **Secure Login & Authentication:** Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, stateless authentication. Passwords are encrypted using `bcrypt`.
- **Visual Dashboard:** A personalized dashboard that presents financial summaries through interactive charts. Customers can quickly visualize their credit vs. debit amounts and see their final balance.
- **Transaction History:** A detailed, paginated, and searchable table of all past transactions, allowing customers to track their spending.
- **Profile Management:** Customers can view and update their personal information. Profile images are uploaded and managed via **ImageKit.io**.
- **Payee Management:** A crucial feature allowing customers to add, view, and delete payees (beneficiaries). This makes frequent fund transfers simple and error-free.
- **Fund Transfers:** A secure form to transfer funds to saved payees.
