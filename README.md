## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Architecture

This project is built using a modern, robust, and scalable technology stack, chosen specifically to meet the high-security and performance demands of a financial application.

* **Frontend:** The mobile application is built with **React Native**, allowing for a single codebase to serve both iOS and Android users. This ensures a consistent user experience across platforms while speeding up development. For state management, we use **Redux Toolkit**, which provides a predictable and centralized state container, essential for managing complex financial data and user sessions.

* **Backend:** The server-side is powered by **Node.js** and the **Express.js** framework. This choice is based on Node.js's non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it highly efficient for handling concurrent user requests and real-time operations. The backend exposes a secure **RESTful API** that the mobile client consumes. Security is paramount, with **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for authenticating API requests and **bcrypt.js** for securely hashing user passwords.

* **Database:** For our data persistence layer, we use **PostgreSQL**. It is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability, data integrity, and ACID-compliant transactions, which are non-negotiable features for a banking application.

Here is a summary of the core technologies:

| Component | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | React Native |
| **State Management** | Redux Toolkit |
| **Backend** | Node.js with Express.js |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL |
| **Authentication** | JWT, bcrypt.js |
| **API Testing** | Postman |
| **Testing** | Jest, React Testing Library |
| **Containerization**| Docker |

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your machine:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (Optional, for containerized setup)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-github-username]/[your-repo-name].git
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup**
    ```sh
    cd server
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following environment variables:
    ```env
    PORT=5000
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[USER]:[PASSWORD]@localhost:5432/[DATABASE_NAME]"
    JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_jwt_key"
    ```
    Run database migrations and start the server:
    ```sh
    npm run db:migrate
    npm run start
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup**
    ```sh
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and add your backend API URL:
    ```env
    API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```
    Start the client application (for iOS or Android):
    ```sh
    npm run ios
    # or
    npm run android
    ```

## üß™ Running Tests
